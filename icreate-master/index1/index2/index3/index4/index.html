      My suggestion for the newcomer is to be constant and not be scared to fail and try new things if you want to become a expert. To become an ethical hacker, one has to concentrate on the basics and avoid being a SKIDS (Script Kiddie).

      If I could go back in time, I would spend more time working on my foundations and honing my talents rather than playing online games. I study from 12:30 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., however I have been prone to forget to study due of online games, so please refrain from playing online games.

      For me, not everyone is made out to be a cyber security specialist; it takes patience and time to excel in this profession. However, if you work hard and are determined, you can become one of us.
